Starting from Android Oreo the _"Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep"_ setting was removed and thus PieFi was born.

# Why PieFi?

With PieFi you can regain control of your Wi-Fi, saving battery, data. and overall good night's sleep.

In addition to the option being unavailable, starting from Android Pie, Wi-Fi cannot be modified if Airplane Mode is on, hence the name _PieFi._ This is a problem to anyone who regularly uses it like I do.
This additional feature requires root.
