#
<p>Starting from Android Oreo the <i>"Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep"</i> setting was removed and thus, PieFi was born.<br><br></p>

# Why PieFi?

PieFi is a **Quick Settings Tile**.

With PieFi you can regain control of your Wi-Fi, saving battery, data, and finally rest easy to get a good night's sleep.

In addition to the option being unavailable, starting from Android Pie, Wi-Fi cannot be modified if Airplane Mode is on, hence the name _PieFi._
This is a problem to anyone who regularly uses it like I do.

*This additional feature requires root.*
